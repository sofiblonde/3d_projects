# 3d_projects
In my opinion, the best 3D projects have been uploaded to this repository. I work preferably in Blender and Substance Painter programs, but I can also retrain for other platforms. I have been engaged in 3D modeling since 2021. Sources, renders, and exported versions of projects are uploaded to the repository. They often work in low poly.

# 3d_projects
In my opinion, the best 3D projects have been uploaded to this repository. I work preferably in Blender and Substance Painter programs, but I can also retrain for other platforms. I have been engaged in 3D modeling since 2021. Sources, renders, and exported versions of projects are uploaded to the repository. They often work in low poly.

Description of the projects:

The room is animated on fans, improvements and changes are still planned, rendering is cyclical.

Ottomans, tables and cabinets - were created for a project for an educational institution, from real objects located in it, rendered on eevee.

The plant was created as a separate object, and is also included as a decorative element in the room, rendering on both eevee and cycles.

The mug is made from an existing object, rendered on eevee.

The pumpkin is made for Halloween.

The sword is made according to the guide, some elements were changed during the creation process, the render is on eevee.

Grass is a small tuft of grass that was used for the environment in a currently closed project, rendered on eevee.

The axe with a carefully designed sweep was planned as an object for texturing on the Substance Painter platform.


The scan was not performed for all works, as well as some technical part of the creation of models was not observed, since these works were used more for rendering.
Some of the works have been uploaded to ArtStation: https://www.artstation.com/sofiblonde
